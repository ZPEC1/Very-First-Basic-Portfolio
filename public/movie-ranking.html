<h1>THE BEST ANIME OF ALL TIME</h1>
<H2>My top 3 anime of all time</H2>
<hr />
<h3>ATTACK ON TITAN</h3>
<P>It is simply the best anime ever made. Best story line. Best animations. Greatest twists. </P>

<H3>ONE PIECE</H3>

<P>I know it has 1000 episodes and still going. But if you are fan of action with good story telling and a lot of mysteries. These 1000 episodes are more than worth it. Especially the beast pirates arc is the best.</P>
<H3>TOKYO GHOUL</H3>
<P>Seasons order is very confusing but i am big fan of great fights with supernatural strngth. Just my personal favourite because of its twisted, evil, crazy storyline.</P>
